For you [Honeycomb][urls.honeycomb] fans we have a new
[`honeycomb` sink][docs.sinks.honeycomb]. Keep an eye on
[PR#1991][urls.pr_1991], which will introduce a new `transaction` transform.
This tranformed is designed to produce "canoncial" events. These are flattened,
wide events that represent an entire transaction, the concept that Honeycomb
is built upon. Vector + Honeycomb = ðŸ‘¯.
