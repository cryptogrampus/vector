The new [`swimlanes` transform][docs.transforms.swimland] makes it much easier
to configure conditional branches of transforms and sinks. For example, you can
easily create [if/else pipelines][docs.transforms.swimlanes#examples].

Remember to occasionally let your branches mingle so that they don't completely
lose touch.
