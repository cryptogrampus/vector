This is an exciting one! v2 of our [`lua` transform][docs.transforms.lua] has
been released. It contains an entirely new API for using Lua within Vector,
unblocking some very important limitations that our v1 (MVP) contained.

<!--truncate-->

* Correct data model and type conversions.
* Introduction of hooks to maintain global state.
* Introduction of timers to facilitate timed flushing. Useful for aggregations.
* The ability to accept and work with metrics data.

This new version comes chock-full of documentation and guides, helping you to
extract the full potential of this transform. To get started:
